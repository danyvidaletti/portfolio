### Projects
**agentic-ai-support-agent**
- A strategic Hack Week project that establishes a centralised Agentic AI framework for the Dynamics 365 Data Assurance team. It transforms unstructured SharePoint documentation into strict, AI-ready logic, ensuring the AI support agent reliably validates account creations, verifications, and hierarchy updates without hallucinating or making unauthorised assumptions.

**brazil-gov-travel-analysis**
- A Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using real-world open data from the Brazilian Transparency Portal (Portal da Transparência). It utilises Pandas and Matplotlib to clean, aggregate, and visualise public travel expenses, uncovering insights such as average trip costs, durations, and financial patterns across different government job titles.

**focus-webpage**
- A fully responsive, multi-page web application named "Focus & Insightful Timing" (FIT) built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It serves as a productivity task manager featuring full CRUD operations, interactive UI elements, and local storage integration to ensure user data persists across browser sessions without relying on external frameworks.

**word-scramble-app**
- An engaging iOS word game built with SwiftUI where players generate as many valid words as possible using letters from a randomly provided root word. It leverages Apple's native UITextChecker for dictionary validation and incorporates dynamic UI updates and custom alerts to enforce game rules and provide instant feedback.

**better-rest-app**
- An intelligent iOS application that utilises Apple's Core ML framework to predict a user's optimal bedtime. By feeding user inputs—such as desired wake-up time, target sleep duration, and daily caffeine intake—into a custom-trained machine learning regression model, it instantly calculates and displays highly personalised sleep recommendations.

**guess-the-flag-app**
- An interactive, SwiftUI-based iOS trivia game that challenges users to identify the correct national flag from a randomised lineup. It features dynamic gameplay, custom background gradients, smooth state management for score tracking, and educational alert messages that provide immediate, specific feedback on incorrect guesses.

**time-converter-app**
- A streamlined iOS utility application built with SwiftUI that instantly calculates and converts time values across multiple units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months). It showcases strong state management and computed mathematical properties to dynamically process user input in real-time via a custom decimal pad and segmented pickers.

**we-split-app**
- iOS application designed to effortlessly calculate and split restaurant bills among a group. Built with SwiftUI, it dynamically updates the total per person in real-time by factoring in the check amount, the number of diners, and a customisable tip percentage, featuring locale-aware currency formatting and interactive form layouts.
